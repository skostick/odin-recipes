    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        After stumbling into Magnolia Bakery on a whim one day, a friend who 
        was visiting and I decided to try the banana pudding. Oh my. It is 
        safe to say that we were quickly obsessed and got it three more times 
        that week. After my friend went back home, we realized that we needed 
        to find a copycat version of the recipe. It's that good.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lo and behold, here it is. It is cheap, easy, and just as good as the real 
        version. We can't make it often in our house because we eat it way too fast.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>One 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (360 grams/12.7 ounces) ice-cold water</li>
        <li>One 3.4-ounce package instant vanilla pudding mix</li>
        <li>3 cups (720 grams/25.5 ounces) heavy cream</li>
        <li>one 11-ounce box Nilla wafers</li>
        <li>4 to 5 ripe bananas, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, beat the 
            condensed milk and water on medium speed until well combined (about 1 minute)</li>
        <li>Add the pudding mix to the mixture and beat until there are no lumps and the 
            mixture is smooth (about 2 minutes)</li>
        <li>Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl, cover and refrigerate until firm</li>
        <li>Whip the heavy cream in the stand mixer on medium speed until it starts to thicken 
            (about 1 minute) and then increase the speed to medium-high and whip until stiff peaks 
            form. Be careful not to overwhip!</li>
        <li>With the mixer running on low speed, add the pudding mixture in, one spoonful at a time 
            and mix until well blended and no streaks of pudding remain</li>
        <li>Starting with a trifle dish, spread some of the pudding over the bottom and layer cookies, 
            followed by banana slices, over top. Repeat until all the ingredients are gone</li>
        <li>Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours. Cookies should be tender 
            when poked with a fork. This dessert is best served within 12 hours of assembling</li>
    </ol>
