    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>Kosher salt</li>
       <li>1 pound thinly sliced chicken cutlets, cut into 1/2-inch-thick-strips</li>
       <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
       <li>8 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed</li>
       <li>6 clobes of garlic, sliced</li>
       <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
       <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
       <li>12 ounces angel hair pasta</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest plus the juice of 1 large lemon</li>
       <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh italian parsley</li>
       <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta. Sprinkle the chicken with 
            some salt. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat until hot, then add the oil. 
            Working in 2 batches, brown the chicken until golden but not cooked through, 2 to 3 
            minutes per batch. Remove the chicken to a plate.</li>
        <li>Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in the skillet. Add the garlic and red pepper 
            flakes and cook until the garlic just begins to turn golden at the edges, 30 seconds 
            to 1 minute. Add the wine, bring to a simmer and cook until reduced by half, about 2 
            minutes. Remove from the heat.  </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the pasta until very al dente, reserving 1 cup of the pasta water. 
            Add the pasta and 3/4 cup pasta water to the skillet along with the chicken, lemon zest 
            and juice and the remaining 4 tablespoons butter. Return the skillet to medium-low heat 
            and gently stir the pasta until the butter is melted, adding the remaining 1/4 pasta water 
            if the pasta seems too dry. Remove the skillet from the heat, sprinkle with the grated cheese 
            and parsley and toss before serving.</li>
    </ol>
